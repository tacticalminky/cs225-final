# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will meet every Monday and Wednesday of each week at 8pm until 9:30pm on Discord. Instead of taking notes by hand, we will keep comments in the Discord group or on the code of what needs to be done.

2. **Assistance** 
The team will be able to contact each other through the Discord chat or through cell phone. The expected response time between members is within 8 hours, except for Drew Mink, who is allowed 1 business day. 

3. **Respect** 
The person is allowed to scream is they feel like they aren't being properly represented during discussion. We also aim to not speak over each other during discussion time to be able to properly listen and respond to the speaker. If the issue persists, an in-person meeting will be held to properly sort out this issue.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**
We will distribute work accordingly based on schedule and availability of each person, and would preferrebly like to distribute the workload based on files. Each person will specialize in one aspect of the project at time, and if they encounter issues will be able to request assistance from others.

5. **Time Commitment** 
We hope to do 4 hours per week per so, such that 3 hours are taken by discussion and 1 on their own time. If their schedule allows for more time, they are encouraged to work more. However, we feel this is fair to allow people as much flexibility as possible into their schedule. However, if need be, a person can take off from a discussion or free work hour to deal with other classes or matters. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If there is a conflict between members about workload or which aspects of the project people want to work on, they will either settle it with a coinflip or an arm wrestle (best 2 out of 3). If they cannot decide which to do, the other member(s) will decide for them. If a person is habitually late, an in-person meeting at a location will be allowed, or the offending member is to owe the others snacks for compensation.
