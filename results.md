# Results

We wrote test cases to test each main function in our code. We had a test case that made sure that the CSV for ratings and animes was read and traslated into nodes and edges correctly. We made a separate, smaller CSV to test these functions at first to simplify debugging.

Doing this project led us to discover which Animes had the most connections and which ones seemed to be the most popular. We also learned which specific Animes were related
